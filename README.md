I am a Data Analyst with solid experience in data analytics, ETL processes, and workflow automation. I utilize SQL, Python, and tools such as Apache Airflow to extract, transform, and analyze data efficiently in order to support business decisions. I have worked on end-to-end data projects covering data collection, cleaning, transformation, visualization, statistical analysis, data warehousing, and insight generation. I am highly passionate about creating automated and scalable data pipelines, improving workflow efficiency, and discovering data-driven strategies through exploratory and time-series analysis. Known for being adaptable, quick to learn, and collaborative, I excel in problem-solving and communication while turning raw data into meaningful insights.
